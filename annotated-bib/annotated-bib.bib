	abstract = {In 2015, Bos, Costello, Naehrig, and Stebila (IEEE Security \& Privacy 2015) proposed an instantiation of Ding's ring-learning-with-errors (Ring-LWE) based key-exchange protocol (also including the tweaks proposed by Peikert from PQCrypto 2014), together with an implementation integrated into OpenSSL, with the affirmed goal of providing post-quantum security for TLS.
	
	In this work we revisit their instantiation and stand-alone implementation. Specifically, we propose new parameters and a better suited error distribution, analyze the scheme's hardness against attacks by quantum computers in a conservative way, introduce a new and more efficient error-reconciliation mechanism, and propose a defense against backdoors and all-for-the-price-of-one attacks. By these measures and for the same lattice dimension, we more than double the security parameter, halve the communication overhead, and speed up computation by more than a factor of 8 in a portable C implementation and by more than a factor of 27 in an optimized implementation targeting current Intel CPUs. These speedups are achieved with comprehensive protection against timing attacks.},

The common gadget inversion problems are the classical (often binary) digit decomposition, subgaussian decomposition, Learning with Errors (LWE) decoding, and discrete Gaussian sampling. In this work, we build and implement an eﬃcient lattice gadget toolkit that provides a general treatment of gadget matrices and algorithms for their inversion/sampling. The main contribution of our work is a set of new gadget matrices and algorithms for eﬃcient subgaussian sampling that have a number of major theoretical and practical advantages over previously known algorithms. Another contribution deals with eﬃcient algorithms for LWE decoding and discrete Gaussian sampling in the Residue Number System (RNS) representation.},

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1555},
	abstract = {LWE based key-exchange protocols lie at the heart of post-quantum public-key cryptography. However, all existing protocols either lack the non-interactive nature of Diffie-Hellman key-exchange or polynomial LWE-modulus, resulting in unwanted efficiency overhead.

We study the possibility of designing non-interactive LWE-based protocols with polynomial LWE-modulus. To this end,

 We identify and formalize simple non-interactive and polynomial LWE-modulus variants of existing protocols, where Alice and Bob simultaneously exchange one or more (ring) LWE samples with polynomial LWE-modulus and then run individual key reconciliation functions to obtain the shared key.

 We point out central barriers and show that such non-interactive key-exchange protocols are impossible if:

1) the reconciliation functions first compute the inner product of the received LWE sample with their private LWE secret. This impossibility is information theoretic.

2) one of the reconciliation functions does not depend on the error of the transmitted LWE sample. This impossibility assumes hardness of LWE.

 We give further evidence that progress in either direction, of giving an LWE-based NIKE protocol or proving impossibility of one will lead to progress on some other well-studied questions in cryptography.

Overall, our results show possibilities and challenges in designing simple (ring) LWE-based non-interactive key exchange protocols.},

This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efﬁcient solution to the learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for GAPSVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical (i.e., non-quantum).},

These tasks were previously the main bottleneck for a wide range of cryptographic schemes, and our techniques substantially improve upon the prior ones, both in terms of practical performance and quality of the produced outputs. Moreover, the simple structure of the new trapdoor and associated algorithms can be exposed in applications, leading to further simpliﬁcations and efﬁciency improvements.
