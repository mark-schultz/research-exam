In this section, we will briefly look into a handleful of papers within lattice cryptography and draw the ``wrong'' conclusions from them.
Specifically, while each of these papers build some variant of lattice-based encryption which is \emph{cryptographically} their most interesting contribution, they do this while (implicitly) introducing new lattice codes that admit efficient decoding.
As the purpose of this work is to make the design of lattice-based KEMs parametric with respect to the underlying choice of lattice code, we collect a variety of effficiently-decodable lattice codes in this section.
