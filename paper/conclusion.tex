While the NIST PQC competition is nearing its end, the design of lattice-based KEMs is headed in an exciting direction, especially with respect to techniques combining non-trivial encodings to achieve smaller bandwidth usage.
Preliminary techniques already achieve $\sim$20\% savings compared to NIST PQC candidates with no negative impacts on running time, and there are many avenues to explore yet.
Moreover, adapting notation that allows these non-trivial encodings to be discussed may enable tighter interplay between various sub-fields of cryptography that are based on ``cryptographic problems from linear algebra''.
